# Model-Compression-BTP
This project explores state-of-the-art techniques in model compression to optimize neural networks for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our approach focuses on reducing the computational complexity and memory footprint of deep learning models without significant degradation in performance.

Techniques under investigation may include, but are not limited to:

Quantization: Lowering precision of weights and activations for efficient inference.
Pruning: Removing redundant connections to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.
Knowledge Distillation: Transferring knowledge from a larger, pre-trained model to a smaller one.
Low-Rank Factorization: Decomposing weight matrices to enhance model efficiency.
Model Sparsity & Clustering: Encouraging sparse representations and weight clustering for compression.
While we aim to leverage existing methodologies, we also seek to introduce novel optimizations to further push the boundaries of compression without compromising the modelâ€™s integrity. This project serves as an evolving exploration of the trade-offs between compression ratios, computational cost, and model fidelity in real-world applications.
